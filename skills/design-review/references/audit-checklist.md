### Design Audit Checklist (10 categories, ~80 items)

Apply these at each page. Each finding gets an impact rating (high/medium/polish) and category.

**1. Visual Hierarchy & Composition** (8 items)
- Clear focal point? One primary CTA per view?
- Eye flows naturally top-left to bottom-right?
- Visual noise — competing elements fighting for attention?
- Information density appropriate for content type?
- Z-index clarity — nothing unexpectedly overlapping?
- Above-the-fold content communicates purpose in 3 seconds?
- Squint test: hierarchy still visible when blurred?
- White space is intentional, not leftover?

**2. Typography** (15 items)
- Font count <=3 (flag if more)
- Scale follows ratio (1.25 major third or 1.333 perfect fourth)
- Line-height: 1.5x body, 1.15-1.25x headings
- Measure: 45-75 chars per line (66 ideal)
- Heading hierarchy: no skipped levels (h1→h3 without h2)
- Weight contrast: >=2 weights used for hierarchy
- Assign display/body/label/mono roles before judging fonts. Read the complete role-scoped lists in [design catalog](../../../references/design-catalog.md); do not infer a display violation from an allowed body/UI role.
- Banned in any role: Papyrus, Comic Sans, Lobster, Impact, Jokerman, Bleeding Cowboys, Permanent Marker, Bradley Hand, Brush Script, Hobo, Trajan, Raleway, Clash Display, Courier New.
- Overused display faces follow the catalog's full list. DM Sans, Instrument Sans, IBM Plex Sans pass for body/UI on an Operate or Read surface when the proposal explicitly assigns that role. JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono, Fira Code are mono options for data/code.
- A user-named face or intentional DESIGN.md choice is respected; state the tradeoff once. Re-verify official family name, required weights, license and loading source before recommending a replacement; offline, inspect local files/licenses or mark selection pending rather than inventing a face or URL.
- `text-wrap: balance` or `text-pretty` on headings (check via mapped computed-style inspection of heading `text-wrap`)
- Curly quotes used, not straight quotes
- Ellipsis character (`…`) not three dots (`...`)
- `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on number columns
- Body text >= 16px
- Caption/label >= 12px
- No letterspacing on lowercase text

**3. Color & Contrast** (10 items)
- Palette coherent (<=12 unique non-gray colors)
- WCAG AA: body text 4.5:1, large text (18px+) 3:1, UI components 3:1
- Semantic colors consistent (success=green, error=red, warning=yellow/amber)
- No color-only encoding (always add labels, icons, or patterns)
- Dark mode: surfaces use elevation, not just lightness inversion
- Dark mode: text off-white (~#E0E0E0), not pure white
- Primary accent desaturated 10-20% in dark mode
- `color-scheme: dark` on html element (if dark mode present)
- No red/green only combinations (8% of men have red-green deficiency)
- Neutral palette is warm or cool consistently — not mixed

**4. Spacing & Layout** (12 items)
- Grid consistent at all breakpoints
- Spacing uses a scale (4px or 8px base), not arbitrary values
- Alignment is consistent — nothing floats outside the grid
- Rhythm: related items closer together, distinct sections further apart
- Border-radius hierarchy (not uniform bubbly radius on everything)
- Inner radius = outer radius - gap (nested elements)
- No horizontal scroll on mobile
- Max content width set (no full-bleed body text)
- `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for notch devices
- URL reflects state (filters, tabs, pagination in query params)
- Flex/grid used for layout (not JS measurement)
- Breakpoints: mobile (375), tablet (768), desktop (1024), wide (1440)

**5. Interaction States** (10 items)
- Hover state on all interactive elements
- `focus-visible` ring present (never `outline: none` without replacement)
- Active/pressed state with depth effect or color shift
- Disabled state: reduced opacity + `cursor: not-allowed`
- Loading: skeleton shapes match real content layout
- Empty states: warm message + primary action + visual (not just "No items.")
- Error messages: specific + include fix/next step
- Success: confirmation animation or color, auto-dismiss
- Touch targets >= 44px on all interactive elements
- `cursor: pointer` on all clickable elements
- Mindless choice audit: every decision point (button, link, dropdown, modal choice) is a mindless click (obvious what happens). If a click requires thought about whether it's the right choice, flag as HIGH.
- Browser surfaces themed from the palette: selection, caret, scrollbars, focus rings, underline offset, tabular numerals. Read computed values rather than judging only custom components.

**6. Responsive Design** (8 items)
- Mobile layout makes *design* sense (not just stacked desktop columns)
- Touch targets sufficient on mobile (>= 44px)
- No horizontal scroll on any viewport
- Images handle responsive (srcset, sizes, or CSS containment)
- Text readable without zooming on mobile (>= 16px body)
- Navigation collapses appropriately (hamburger, bottom nav, etc.)
- Forms usable on mobile (correct input types, no autoFocus on mobile)
- No `user-scalable=no` or `maximum-scale=1` in viewport meta

**7. Motion & Animation** (6 items)
- Easing: ease-out for entering, ease-in for exiting, ease-in-out for moving
- Duration: 50-700ms range (nothing slower unless page transition)
- Purpose: every animation communicates something (state change, attention, spatial relationship)
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected (check via mapped read-only evaluation: `matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches`)
- No `transition: all` — properties listed explicitly
- Only `transform` and `opacity` animated (not layout properties like width, height, top, left)
- One authored motion moment at the moment that deserves attention, plus informative state transitions; start from a visible default, never hide content behind an animation that may not run.

**8. Content & Microcopy** (8 items)
- Empty states designed with warmth (message + action + illustration/icon)
- Error messages specific: what happened + why + what to do next
- Button labels specific ("Save API Key" not "Continue" or "Submit")
- No placeholder/lorem ipsum text visible in production
- Truncation handled (`text-overflow: ellipsis`, `line-clamp`, or `break-words`)
- Active voice ("Install the CLI" not "The CLI will be installed")
- Loading states end with `…` ("Saving…" not "Saving...")
- Destructive actions have confirmation modal or undo window
- Happy talk detection: scan for introductory paragraphs that start with "Welcome to..." or tell users how great the site is. If you can hear "blah blah blah", it's happy talk. Flag for removal.
- Instructions detection: any visible instructions longer than one sentence. If users need to read instructions, the design has failed. Flag the instructions AND the interaction they're compensating for.
- Happy talk word count: count total visible words on the page. Classify each text block as "useful content" vs "happy talk" (welcome paragraphs, self-congratulatory text, instructions nobody reads). Report: "This page has X words. Y (Z%) are happy talk."

**9. AI Slop Detection** (11 legacy patterns plus the complete catalog)

Read [the complete design catalog](../../../references/design-catalog.md) in full: apply every legacy pattern, detector-known slop rule and judgment tell, not only the examples below. Keep printed rule ids, impact, confidence, tier, role exclusions and heuristics. Quality entries also inform their matching checklist categories. One element flagged by the detector and manual judgment is one finding, credited to both; a rule's location list is not a finding per hit. Advisory rows do not count; polish findings do not affect grade. HIGH mechanical CSS suggestions may enter the authorized fix loop, not automatic edits during baseline; LOW-confidence patterns remain possible until visually confirmed. Intentional DESIGN.md tokens/decisions calibrate all rows. An unavailable detector does not skip manual catalog coverage.

The test: would a human designer at a respected studio ever ship this?

- Purple/violet/indigo gradient backgrounds or blue-to-purple color schemes
- **The 3-column feature grid:** icon-in-colored-circle + bold title + 2-line description, repeated 3x symmetrically. THE most recognizable AI layout.
- Icons in colored circles as section decoration (SaaS starter template look)
- Centered everything (`text-align: center` on all headings, descriptions, cards)
- Uniform bubbly border-radius on every element (same large radius on everything)
- Decorative blobs, floating circles, wavy SVG dividers (if a section feels empty, it needs better content, not decoration)
- Emoji as design elements (rockets in headings, emoji as bullet points)
- Colored left-border on cards (`border-left: 3px solid <accent>`)
- Generic hero copy ("Welcome to [X]", "Unlock the power of...", "Your all-in-one solution for...")
- Cookie-cutter section rhythm (hero → 3 features → testimonials → pricing → CTA, every section same height)
- system-ui or `-apple-system` as the PRIMARY display/body font — the "I gave up on typography" signal. Pick a real typeface.

**10. Performance as Design** (6 items)
- LCP < 2.0s (web apps), < 1.5s (informational sites)
- CLS < 0.1 (no visible layout shifts during load)
- Skeleton quality: shapes match real content layout, shimmer animation
- Images: `loading="lazy"`, width/height dimensions set, WebP/AVIF format
- Fonts: `font-display: swap`, preconnect to CDN origins
- No visible font swap flash (FOUT) — critical fonts preloaded
