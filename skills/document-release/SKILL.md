version: 1.0.0
description: |
  Post-ship documentation update. Reads all project docs, cross-references the
  diff, builds a Diataxis coverage map (reference/how-to/tutorial/explanation),
  updates README/ARCHITECTURE/CONTRIBUTING/CLAUDE.md to match what shipped,
  detects architecture diagram drift, polishes CHANGELOG voice with a sell-test
  rubric, cleans up TODOS, and optionally bumps VERSION. Surfaces documentation
  debt in the PR body. Use when asked to "update the docs", "sync documentation",
  or "post-ship docs". Proactively suggest after a PR is merged or code is shipped.

Read `../../references/external-actions.md`, `../../references/content-guard.md` and
`references/runtime.md` before the workflow. They resolve authorization and the original
host/tool/path/revision associations; the documentation domain phases below are preserved.

## Step 0: Detect platform and base branch

Follow `references/runtime.md` to resolve the explicit project, base/head, comparison method
and hosting convention. There is no silent default base, `/ship` invocation or feature-branch
prerequisite. Use the recorded `<diff-base>` and `<head>` in subsequent Git examples.

# Document Release: Post-Ship Documentation Update

You are running the `/document-release` workflow. This runs after code is ready or shipped,
before or after the PR merges, without requiring another skill. Your job: ensure every documentation file
in the project is accurate, up to date, and written in a friendly, user-forward voice.

You are mostly automated. Make obvious factual updates directly. Stop and ask only for risky or
subjective decisions.

**Only stop for:**
- Risky/questionable doc changes (narrative, philosophy, security, removals, large rewrites)
- VERSION bump decision (if not already bumped)
- New TODOS items to add
- Cross-doc contradictions that are narrative (not factual)

**Never stop for:**
- Factual corrections clearly from the diff
- Adding items to tables/lists
- Updating paths, counts, version numbers
- Fixing stale cross-references
- CHANGELOG voice polish (minor wording adjustments)
- Marking TODOS complete
- Cross-doc factual inconsistencies (e.g., version number mismatch)

**NEVER do:**
- Overwrite, replace, or regenerate CHANGELOG entries — polish wording only, preserve all content
- Bump VERSION without asking — always use AskUserQuestion for version changes
- Use `Write` tool on CHANGELOG.md — always use `Edit` with exact `old_string` matches

## Section index — Read each section when its situation applies

This skill is a decision-tree skeleton. The steps below point to on-demand
sections. Read a section in full before doing its step; do not work from memory.

| When | Read this section |
|------|-------------------|
| auditing each doc file and applying updates, polishing CHANGELOG voice, checking cross-doc consistency, cleaning up TODOS, the VERSION bump, and committing (Steps 2-9, after the coverage map in Step 1.5) | `references/release-body.md` |
| performing the original independent documentation review after updates | `references/cross-model-review.md` |

## Step 1: Pre-flight & Diff Analysis

1. Check the current checkout against the explicitly selected release head. Resolve an
   unavailable or ambiguous range before proceeding; being on the base branch does not abort the audit.

2. Gather context about what changed:

```bash
git diff <diff-base> <head> --stat
```

```bash
git log <diff-base>..<head> --oneline
```

```bash
git diff <diff-base> <head> --name-only
```

3. Discover all documentation files in the repo:

```bash
find . -maxdepth 2 -name "*.md" -not -path "./.git/*" -not -path "./node_modules/*" -not -path "./.context/*" | sort
```

4. Classify the changes into categories relevant to documentation:
   - **New features** — new files, new commands, new skills, new capabilities
   - **Changed behavior** — modified services, updated APIs, config changes
   - **Removed functionality** — deleted files, removed commands
   - **Infrastructure** — build system, test infrastructure, CI

5. Output a brief summary: "Analyzing N files changed across M commits. Found K documentation files to review."

## Step 1.5: Coverage Map (Blast-Radius Analysis)

Before touching any documentation file, build a **coverage map** of what shipped vs what's
documented. This is inspired by the Diataxis framework (tutorial / how-to / reference / explanation)
— but applied as an audit lens, not a generation tool.

1. **Extract public surface changes from the diff.** Scan `git diff <diff-base> <head>` for:
   - New exported functions, classes, commands, CLI flags, config options, API endpoints
   - New skills, workflows, or user-facing capabilities
   - Renamed or removed public surface (modules, commands, features)
   - New environment variables, feature flags, or configuration knobs

2. **For each new/changed public surface item, assess documentation coverage:**

```
Coverage map:
  [entity]         [reference?] [how-to?] [tutorial?] [explanation?]
  /new-skill       ✅ AGENTS.md  ❌        ❌          ❌
  --new-flag       ✅ README     ✅ README  ❌          ❌
  FooProcessor     ❌            ❌        ❌          ❌
```

Use these definitions:
- **Reference** — factual description of what it is, its API, its options (README tables, AGENTS.md skill lists, API docs)
- **How-to** — task-oriented: "how to do X with this" (README examples, CONTRIBUTING workflows)
- **Tutorial** — learning-oriented: step-by-step walkthrough for newcomers (getting started guides)
- **Explanation** — understanding-oriented: "why this works this way" (ARCHITECTURE decisions, design rationale)

3. **Output the coverage map.** Items with zero coverage are **critical gaps** — flag them for
   Step 3. Items with reference-only coverage are **common gaps** — note them for the PR body.

4. **Architecture diagram drift detection.** If ARCHITECTURE.md (or any doc) contains ASCII
   diagrams or Mermaid blocks, extract entity names (modules, services, data flows) from the
   diagrams. Cross-reference against the diff. Flag any diagram entities that were renamed,
   split, removed, or moved in the code.

The coverage map feeds into Steps 2-3 (what to audit and fix) and Step 9 (documentation debt
summary in the PR body). Do NOT auto-generate missing documentation pages — flag gaps only.
When significant gaps are found, suggest running `/document-generate` to fill them.

Read `references/release-body.md` in full for Steps 2-9.

## Important Rules

- **Read before editing.** Always read the full content of a file before modifying it.
- **Never clobber CHANGELOG.** Polish wording only. Never delete, replace, or regenerate entries.
- **Never bump VERSION silently.** Always ask. Even if already bumped, check whether it covers the full scope of changes.
- **Be explicit about what changed.** Every edit gets a one-line summary.
- **Generic heuristics, not project-specific.** The audit checks work on any repo.
- **Discoverability matters.** Every doc file should be reachable from README or CLAUDE.md.
- **Coverage map informs, never generates.** The Diataxis coverage map flags gaps for the PR body
  and future work. It does NOT auto-generate missing documentation pages or sections. When gaps
  are found, suggest `/document-generate` as the follow-up skill.
- **Diagram drift is advisory.** Flag stale architecture diagrams in the PR body but do not
  auto-edit ASCII art or Mermaid blocks — they require human judgment to update correctly.
- **Voice: friendly, user-forward, not obscure.** Write like you're explaining to a smart person
  who hasn't seen the code.
